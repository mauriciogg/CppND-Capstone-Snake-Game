# CPPND: Enhanced Snake Game with AI Opponent

This is an enhanced version of the Snake game with an AI opponent that uses A* pathfinding algorithm. The project demonstrates advanced C++ programming concepts including concurrency, smart pointers, RAII, and algorithmic pathfinding.

## New Features Added

### ðŸ¤– AI Snake Opponent
- **Intelligent Movement**: AI snake uses A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate to food optimally
- **Balanced Difficulty**: AI has reduced speed and occasional suboptimal moves for fair gameplay
- **Visual Distinction**: Player snake is blue, AI snake is red

### ðŸŽ® Enhanced Gameplay
- **Competitive Scoring**: Both player and AI scores are tracked and displayed in the window title
- **Collision Reset**: Game resets on collision instead of terminating, allowing continuous play
- **Round-based Play**: Each collision ends a round with score comparison and restart

### ðŸ§µ Concurrent Processing
- **Multi-threaded AI**: A* pathfinding runs in a separate thread to maintain smooth gameplay
- **Thread-safe Communication**: Uses mutexes and condition variables for safe data sharing
- **Real-time Updates**: AI continuously recalculates optimal paths during gameplay

### ðŸ’» Modern C++ Features
- **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management with `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`
- **RAII**: Resource management for threads, mutexes, and SDL resources
- **STL Containers**: Priority queues for A*, vectors for paths, unordered sets for visited nodes
- **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Clean OOP design with base snake class and specialized implementations

## Expected Program Behavior

### Game Mechanics
- **Player Control**: Use arrow keys to control the blue snake
- **AI Behavior**: Red AI snake automatically navigates toward food using optimal pathfinding
- **Food Collection**: Both snakes compete for the same food item
- **Growth**: Snakes grow longer and slightly faster when eating food
- **Collision Handling**: Any collision (snake-to-snake or self-collision) resets the game

### Console Output
When the game starts:
```
Game has terminated successfully!
Player Score: X
Player Size: Y
AI Score: Z
AI Size: W
```

During gameplay, each collision triggers:
```
=== GAME OVER ===
Final Scores - Player: X | AI: Y
Snake Sizes - Player: A | AI: B
[Player wins this round! / AI wins this round! / It's a tie!]
Restarting game...
```

### Visual Elements
- **Window Title**: Shows real-time scores and FPS: "Player: X AI: Y FPS: Z"
- **Player Snake**: Blue colored segments
- **AI Snake**: Red colored segments  
- **Food**: Yellow/gold colored
- **Background**: Dark gray

### Performance
- **Smooth Gameplay**: 60 FPS target with concurrent AI processing
- **Responsive Controls**: Player input handled in main thread
- **Balanced AI**: Strategic delays and randomness prevent AI from being unbeatable
